# Graphic Design Theses 2020-2021

![xkcd](thesis_defense_2x.png)

## Small Round of Introductions

## The Assignment

Conceive, write and design your thesis for the following media:

1. **web** (HTML/CSS/JavaScript, distribution: git/Github)
2. **print** (HTML/CSS, distribution: Pumbo/Print on Demand)

Unbox and present you theses during the **Open Day** (22/01/2020)

## Mobile First (and Only)

Since we have very little time this year, we will focus on web design for **mobile phones**. We will also use the mobile as presentation device during the open day.

This means that we will keep in mind the limits and affordances of mobile phones (small screen, multiple orientation, etc.) when designing the thesis. We won't worry too much of desktop, since generally what works on smaller screens works also on bigger ones.

Working with the mobile sensors (camera, gyroscope, etc.) is possible but generally difficult with websites), so it's discouraged.

You will also design a **digital dynamic poster** summarizing the content and arguments of your thesis. The posters will be presented during the collectives.

## Print on Demand

We will use [Pumbo](https://www.pumbo.nl/kosten/boek-maken/drukken-in-grote-oplage/paperback) to print the theses.

The format will be 'pocket' (150 x 215mm).

### Some examples of print on demand publications

## Open day (TBD)

![unboxing](unboxing.jpg)

During the Open Day (22/01/2020) we will do a public online performance consisting in 'unboxing' the printed theses and browsing the mobile ones.

We will also organize a small program of public presentations of the theses.

## Extra-Team

Who wants to design the **landing page** for this year's theses? Here you can see [2020](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-20/), [2019](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19/) and [2018](https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-18/) versions.

Also, who wants to organize the **unboxing** during the Open Day?

Generally, it is good to have a group of ~5 people to keep track of these tasks. This doesn't mean however that these ~5 people need to do all by themselves: they can delegate subtasks to other students.

Please write to me either via email (s.lorusso [at] kabk [dot] nl) or Teams to let me know that you want to be part of the extra team.

## Deadlines

**23/12/2019**: you have talked to Silvio and Thomas at least once and you have a sound direction for the design (both in print and web) of your thesis

**20/01/2020**: both your print and web designs are ready for the Open Day, which means that the websites are published on Github and thus accessible online

**22/01/2020**: Open Day, unboxing and presentations

**28-9/01/2020**: the collectives take place

## Tips

![Firefox Responsive UI](responsive_ui.png)

- Use the [responsive mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Responsive_Design_Mode) of the console of your browser to test your design
- Test also on the actual mobile phone, as the rendering might be different.
- If something doesn't work, *formulate the problem*: make an effort to clearly state what and how things should work. A well-formulated problem is half-solved 
- If something doesn't work, *isolate the problem*: create a [CodePen](https://codepen.io/#) only including what is needed to reproduce the bug
- Be tidy with your code: give proper indentation, separate sections, comment complicated parts etc. In this way you and others will be able to navigate your code. Here's some [tips](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/top-15-best-practices-for-writing-super-readable-code--net-8118)
- Think of the invisible structure of your page ahead (what div contains what div)

## git/Github sesh

You should have a Github account by now and I should have added you to the KABK team. So now we will go trough the process of creating a repository and pushing stuff to it with the Terminal to understand conceptually what goes on when we do so. Generally you can use the git engine included in Atom or the app provided by [Github](https://desktop.github.com/).

## Thinking for the (Mobile) Web: Dealing with Footnotes

_No standard method_

	<p>Maintaining <a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#footnotes" id="footnotes-ref">footnotes</a> manually can be a pain.</p>
	
	<ol>
  		<li id="footnotes">Footnotes are notes placed at the bottom of a page. They cite references or comment on a designated part of the text above it. <a href="#footnotes-ref" aria-label="Back to content">‚Ü©</a></li>
	</ol>
